# Views in JavaScript Scheduler control

The Scheduler includes a wide variety of view modes with unique configuration options for each view. The available view modes are Day, Week, Work Week, Month, Agenda, Month Agenda, Year, Timeline Day, Timeline Week, Timeline Work Week, Timeline Year, and Timeline Month, of which the `Week` view is set as active by default.

To navigate between different views and dates, navigation options are available at the Scheduler header bar. The active view option is highlighted by default. The date range of the active view is displayed at the left corner of the header bar. Clicking on the date range opens a calendar popup for easy date selection.

> By default, the Scheduler displays the calendar views such as Day, Week, Work Week, Month, and Agenda.

## Setting specific view on scheduler

As the Scheduler displays the `week` view by default, therefore to change the active view, set the [`currentView`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/schedule#currentview)property with the desired view name. The applicable view names that the Scheduler accepts are as follows:

* Day
* Week
* WorkWeek
* Month
* Year
* Agenda
* MonthAgenda
* TimelineDay
* TimelineWeek
* TimelineWorkWeek
* TimelineMonth
* TimelineYear

Import and inject the appropriate view modules into the application to make use of these view modes on the Scheduler. It is also possible to display only the desired views on the Scheduler. To define and configure specific views, use the [`views`](../api/schedule/views) property.

In the following example, the Scheduler displays four views: Week, Month, TimelineWeek, and TimelineMonth. The appropriate view modules are imported and injected properly to display those views on the Scheduler.

### Week view

The Week view displays a count of seven days (from Sunday to Saturday) with all its related appointments. The first day of the week can be changed using the [`firstDayOfWeek`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/schedule/views#firstdayofweek) which accepts the integer values(Sunday=0, Monday=1, Tuesday=2 and so on) value. Navigate to a particular date in the day view from the week view by clicking on the appropriate dates on the date header bar.

### Work Week view

The Work week view displays only the working days of a week (count of 5 days) and its associated appointments. It is possible to customize the working days on the work week view by using the [`workDays`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/schedule/views#workdays) property which accepts an array of integer values (such as Sunday=0, Monday=1, Tuesday=2 and so on). By default, it displays from Monday to Friday (5 days). You can also navigate to a particular date in the day view from the work week view by clicking on the appropriate dates in the date header bar.

The following code example depicts how to change the working days only on the `Work Week` view of the Scheduler.

> The Week, Work week and Day views can display the all-day row appointments in a separate all-day row with an expand/collapse option to view it.

### Month view

The Month view displays the entire days of a particular month and all its related appointments. Navigate to a particular date in the day view by clicking on the appropriate date text on the month cells.

By default, when creating an appointment through the Month view, it is considered as created for an entire day. Explicitly change this behavior by unchecking the `All-day` option from editor window, which defaults to the start time duration as 9.00 AM and end time as 9.30 AM.

The `+ more` text indicator appears on each day cell of a Month view. Clicking on it allows you to viewing the hidden appointments of a day.

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/javascript/schedule/view-cs7" %}
{% endif %}

 > The year view also has module support. In displays all the months of a particular year in a calendar view format. In that calendar view, appointment contained dates are highlighted with dots placed under the individual date. Clicking on the date, the event popup will be displayed and the events will be listed.

### Agenda view

The Agenda view lists appointments in a grid-like view for the next 7 days by default from the current date. The count of the days can be changed using the API [`agendaDaysCount`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/schedule#agendadayscount). It allows virtual scrolling of dates by enabling the [`allowVirtualScrolling`]([`allowVirtualScrolling`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/schedule/views#allowvirtualscrolling)) property. Also, you can enable or disable the display of days on Scheduler that has no appointments by setting true or false to the [`hideEmptyAgendaDays`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/schedule#hideemptyagendadays) property.

The following code example depicts how to customize the display of events within Agenda view alone.

> Setting the Scheduler height in pixels is mandatory for the Agenda view.

### Month Agenda view

A Month-Agenda view shows a month calendar, where clicking on a particular day will display the appointments present on that date below the calendar. The day with appointments are differentiated with a circular dot below the date of the calendar.

The following code example shows how to hide the weekend days on `MonthAgenda` view as well as the working days list is modified on Month Agenda view alone.

### Timeline views – Day, Week, Work Week

Similar to the day view, timeline day view shows a single day with all its appointments where the time slots are displayed horizontally. By default, the cell height adjusts as per the height set to Scheduler. When the number of appointments exceeds the visible area of the cells, the `+ more` text indicator will be displayed at the bottom to denote the presence of few more appointments in that time range.

To make use of the timeline views (Timeline Day, Timeline Week and Timeline Work Week) on Scheduler, import and inject the module `TimelineViews` from the `ej2-schedule` package.

### Timeline Year view

In Timeline Year view, each row depicts a single resource. Whereas in the vertical view, each resource is grouped parallelly as columns. Here, the resource grouping follows the tree-view like hierarchical grouping structure and can contain any level of child resources.

To make use of the timeline Year view on Scheduler, import and inject `TimelineYear` module from the `ej2-schedule` package.

Timeline Year view is available in both the `Horizontal` and `Vertical` orientations. You can manage the orientation of Timeline Year view through `views` property.

#### Resource grouping

The following code example depicts how to group the multiple resources on Timeline Year view and its relevant events are displayed accordingly under those resources.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "typescript" %}

 {% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/javascript/schedule/view-cs15/index.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="datasource.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/javascript/schedule/view-cs15/datasource.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% endhighlight %}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/javascript/schedule/view-cs15" %}
{% endif %}

#### Auto row height

Timeline Year view supports Auto row height. When the feature [`rowAutoHeight`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/schedule#rowautoheight) is enabled, the row height gets auto-adjusted based on the number of overlapping events occupied in the same time range. If auto row height is disabled, the `+ more` text indicator on each day cell of a Timeline Year view, clicking on which will allow you to view the hidden appointments of a day.

## Extending view intervals

Customize the display of the default number of days on different Scheduler view modes. For example, extend the Day view to display 3 days by setting the `interval` option as 3 for the `Day` option within the `views` property as depicted in the following code example. In the same way, you can also display 2 weeks by setting interval 2 for the `Week` option.

Provide an alternative display name for such customized views on the Scheduler header bar, by setting the appropriate [`displayName`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/schedule/views#displayname) property.

> The view intervals can be extended on all the Scheduler view modes except Agenda and Month-Agenda views.

The [`isSelected`]((https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/schedule/views#isselected)) property can be used to set the current view of the scheduler. The below code sample demonstrates that how to use [`isSelected`]((https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/schedule/views#isselected)) property.
