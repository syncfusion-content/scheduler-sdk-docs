# Client side validation using form validator in React Timepicker component

The TimePicker component can be integrated with the [Essential<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> JavaScript 2 FormValidator](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/form-validator/) to validate time input. The FormValidator allows you to customize error messages and control validation behavior for each field.

In the following example, the required field validation is implemented by mapping the name attribute value to the rules property. It validates the TimePicker component and displays the validation message when the textbox value is empty, during form post back or focus out.
