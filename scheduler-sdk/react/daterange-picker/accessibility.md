## WAI-ARIA attributes

Web accessibility standards define practices to make web content and applications more accessible to users with disabilities. WAI-ARIA attributes are particularly valuable for dynamic content and advanced user interface controls built with AJAX, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.

The DateRangePicker component provides built-in compliance with [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/examples/datepicker-dialog/) specifications through attributes applied to the input element: `aria-expanded`, `aria-disabled`, and `aria-activedescendant`. The component also includes grid role and grid cell attributes for each day cell to enhance semantic meaning.

For related information, refer to the Calendar component's [Accessibility](../calendar/accessibility/) section.

These attributes enable users with disabilities to interact effectively with the DateRangePicker through assistive technologies such as screen readers.

* **aria-expanded**: Indicates whether the DateRangePicker popup is expanded or collapsed.

* **aria-disabled**: Indicates the disabled state of the DateRangePicker component.
