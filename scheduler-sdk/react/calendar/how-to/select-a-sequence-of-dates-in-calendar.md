# Select a sequence of dates in calendar in React Calendar component

The following example demonstrates how to select the week dates for a chosen date in the Calendar using the [`values`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/calendar#values) property when [`isMultiSelection`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/calendar#ismultiselection) is enabled. Moment.js is used in this sample to calculate the start and end of the week for the selected date.

> To parse, format, and manipulate date values, this sample uses Moment.js. Install it with the following command:

`npm i moment`
