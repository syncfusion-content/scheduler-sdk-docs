# Style and Appearance in React Scheduler

To customize the Scheduler's appearance, override its default CSS. You can also create a custom theme with [Theme Studio](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/themestudio/?theme=tailwind3). The following table lists common Scheduler CSS classes used for styling different views and elements.

> **Tip:** Start with the view-specific CSS class and add more specific selectors only when necessary.
