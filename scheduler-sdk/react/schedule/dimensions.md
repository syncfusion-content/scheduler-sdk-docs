# Dimensions in React Scheduler

Scheduler dimensions refer to the height and width of the entire layout and support three types of values:

* `auto`
* `pixel`
* `percentage`

## Auto height and width

When the [height](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#height) and [width](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#width) of the Scheduler are set to `auto`, it will adapt to fit the parent container's dimensions. The Scheduler's width and height will be the sum of its children elements, ensuring responsive layout behavior.

> **Note:** By default, the Scheduler is assigned with `auto` values for both height and width properties, making it responsive to its parent container.

## Height and width in pixels

The Scheduler height and width will render exactly as per the given pixel values.

> **Note:** Pixel values can be provided either as numbers (for example, `500`) or as strings with a `px` suffix (for example, `'500px'`).

## Height and width in percentages

When the height and width of the Scheduler are specified as percentages, the Scheduler will scale proportionally to the parent container's dimensions.

> **Tip:** Percentage-based dimensions are useful for responsive designs that need to adapt to different screen sizes.
