# Localization in React Scheduler

The Scheduler supports multiple date-time formats and cultures, enabling global usage and meeting diverse regional requirements.

You can adapt the Scheduler to different languages by parsing and formatting dates or numbers ([`Internationalization`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/internationalization)), and by adding culture-specific customization and translations for text ([`Localization`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/localization)).

## Globalization

The Internationalization library provides support for formatting and parsing numbers, dates, and times using official [`Unicode CLDR`](http://cldr.unicode.org/) JSON data. It also provides the `loadCldr` method to load culture-specific CLDR JSON data.

By default, the Scheduler follows the English culture (`en-US`). To use a different culture, follow these steps:

* Install the `ej2-cldr-data` package using the Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> npm package:

  ```
  npm install @syncfusion/ej2-cldr-data --save
  ```

Once installed, the culture-specific JSON data can be found under `\node_modules\@syncfusion\ej2-cldr-data`.

* Import the required cultures into the `app.ts` file as shown below:

    1. numberingSystems.json
    2. ca-gregorian.json
    3. numbers.json
    4. timeZoneNames.json

   ```ts
    // Import loadCldr from ej2-base
    import { loadCldr } from '@syncfusion/ej2-base';
    import frNumberData from '@syncfusion/ej2-cldr-data/main/fr-CH/numbers.json';
    import frTimeZoneData from '@syncfusion/ej2-cldr-data/main/fr-CH/timeZoneNames.json';
    import frGregorian from '@syncfusion/ej2-cldr-data/main/fr-CH/ca-gregorian.json';
    import frNumberingSystem from '@syncfusion/ej2-cldr-data/supplemental/numberingSystems.json';

    loadCldr(frNumberData, frTimeZoneData, frGregorian, frNumberingSystem);
  ```

* Set the culture in the Scheduler using the `locale` property.

For more information about globalization, refer to the [Internationalization](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/common/globalization/internationalization) section.

## Localizing static Scheduler text

The [Localization](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/localization) library enables displaying all static text, date content, and time modes of the Scheduler in the localized language. To achieve this, set the `locale` property of the Scheduler and define translations for static words using the `load` method.

For example, the following code defines French translations for all static words used in the Scheduler:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/localization-cs2/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/localization-cs2/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/localization-cs2/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/localization-cs2" %}

The localized words for static text used in the Scheduler and Recurrence Editor can be found in the following code. Static text for all cultures is available [`here`](https://github.com/syncfusion/ej2-locale).

        }
    }
});
```

## Setting date format

The Scheduler supports all valid date formats. By default, it follows the universal format `MM/dd/yyyy`. If the [`dateFormat`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#dateformat) property is not specified, the Scheduler uses the format based on the assigned locale. Since the default locale is `en-US`, the Scheduler follows the `MM/dd/yyyy` pattern.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs19/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs19/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs19/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs19" %}

## Setting the time format

Time formats is a way of representing the time value in different string formats in the Scheduler. By default, the time mode of the Scheduler can be either 12 or 24 hours format which is completely based on the `locale` set to the Scheduler. Since the default `locale` value of the Scheduler is en-US, the time mode will be set to 12 hours format automatically. You can also customize the format by using the [`timeFormat`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#timeformat) property. To know more about the time format standards, refer to the [Date and Time Format](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/common/globalization/internationalization#custom-formats) section.

The following example demonstrates the Scheduler in 24-hour format:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs20/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs20/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs20/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs20" %}

> Note: The [`timeFormat`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#timeformat) property only accepts valid time formats.

## First day of the week

The first day of the week can be set in the Scheduler using the `firstDayOfWeek` property. This ensures the Scheduler starts with the specified day.

> Sunday is denoted as 0, Monday as 1, Tuesday as 2, and so on.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs21/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs21/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs21/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs21" %}

## Displaying Scheduler in RTL mode

The Scheduler layout and behavior can be changed to follow RTL (Right-to-Left) conventions by setting [`enableRtl`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#enablertl) to `true`. This displays the Scheduler layout from right to left. The default value is `false`.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs22/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs22/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs22/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs22" %}
