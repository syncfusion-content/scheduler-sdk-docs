# State persistence in React Schedule component

State persistence allows the Scheduler to retain the [`currentView`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#currentview), [`selectedDate`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#selecteddate) and scroll position values in the [`localStorage`](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp#) for state maintenance even if the browser is refreshed or you navigate to another page. This behavior is enabled through the [`enablePersistence`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#enablepersistence) property, which is disabled by default. When set to `true`, the Scheduler's `currentView`, `selectedDate` and scroll position values are preserved after a page refresh.

> **Note**: The Scheduler `id` is required to enable state persistence.

The following sample demonstrates how to set state persistence of the Scheduler component.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs26/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs26/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs26/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
