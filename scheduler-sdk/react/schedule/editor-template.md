# Editor template in React Schedule component

The Scheduler uses popups and dialogs to display notifications and provides a detailed event editor window to simplify appointment creation and editing. You can customize this editor window, its fields, and apply validations as needed.

## Event editor

The editor window usually opens on the Scheduler, when a cell or event is double clicked. When a cell is double clicked, the detailed editor window opens in "Add new" mode, whereas when an event is double clicked, the same is opened in an "Edit" mode.

In mobile devices, you can open the detailed editor window in edit mode by clicking the edit icon on the popup, that opens on single tapping an event. You can also open it in add mode by single tapping a cell, which will display a `+` indication, clicking on it again will open the editor window.

> You can prevent the editor window from opening by rendering Scheduler in a [`readonly`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#readonly) mode or by doing code customization within the [`popupOpen`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#popupopen) event.

### How to change the editor window header title and text of footer buttons

You can customize the header title and footer button text by updating the corresponding localized strings in the Scheduler.

### How to change the label text of default editor fields

To change the default labels such as Subject, Location and other field names in the editor window, make use of the `title` property available within the field option of [`eventSettings`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule/eventSettings).

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs9" %}

### Field validation

It is possible to validate the required fields of the editor window from client-side before submitting it, by adding appropriate validation rules to each field. The appointment fields have been extended to accept both `string` and `object` type values. To perform validations, it is necessary to specify object values for the event fields.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs10/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs10/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs10/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/local-data-cs10" %}

> Applicable validation rules can be referred from [form validation](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/form-validator/validation-rules) documentation.

### Add additional fields to the default editor

The additional fields can be added to the default event editor by making use of the [`popupOpen`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#popupopen) event which gets triggered before the event editor opens on the Scheduler. The [`popupOpen`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#popupopen) is a client-side event that triggers before any of the generic popups opens on the Scheduler. The additional field (any of the form elements) should be added with a common class name `e-field`, so as to handle and process those additional data along with the default event object. In the following example, an additional field `Event Type` has been added to the default event editor and its value is processed accordingly.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/editor-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/editor-cs1" %}

### Customizing the default time duration in editor window

In default event editor window, start and end time duration are processed based on the `interval` value set within the [`timeScale`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#timescale) property. By default, [`interval`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule/timeScale#interval) value is set to 30, and therefore the start/end time duration within the event editor will be in a 30 minutes time difference. You can change this duration value by changing the [`duration`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule/popupOpenEventArgs#duration) option within the [`popupOpen`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#popupopen) event as shown in the following code example.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/editor-cs2" %}

### How to prevent the display of editor and quick popups

To prevent the editor or quick info popup from appearing, set the `cancel` property to `true` in the [`popupOpen`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#popupopen) event.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/editor-cs3/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/editor-cs3/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/editor-cs3/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/editor-cs3" %}

To prevent only specific popups, check the `type` property in the [`popupOpen`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule/popupOpenEventArgs) event arguments. The available popup types are:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Editor | For Detailed editor window.|
| QuickInfo | For Quick popup which opens on cell click.|
| EditEventInfo |For  Quick popup which opens on event click.|
| ViewEventInfo | For Quick popup which opens on responsive mode.|
| EventContainer | For more event indicator popup.|
| RecurrenceAlert | For edit recurrence event alert popup.|
| DeleteAlert | For delete confirmation popup.|
| ValidationAlert | For validation alert popup.|
| RecurrenceValidationAlert | For recurrence validation alert popup.|

### Customizing timezone collection in the editor window

By default, the timezone collections in the editor window have been loaded with built-in timezone collections. Now we can be able to customize the timezone collections using the [`timezoneDataSource`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#timezonedatasource) property with the collection of [`TimezoneFields`](https://helpej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule/timezoneFields) data.

## Customizing event editor using template

The event editor window can be customized by making use of the [`editorTemplate`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#editortemplate) option. Here, the custom window design is built with the required fields using the script template and its type should be of **text/x-template**.

Each field defined within template should contain the **e-field** class, so as to allow the processing of those field values internally. The ID of this customized script template section is assigned to the [`editorTemplate`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#editortemplate) option, so that these customized fields will be replaced onto the default editor window.

>Note: **e-field** class only applicable for **DropDownList**, **DateTimePicker**, **MultiSelect**, **DatePicker**, **CheckBox** and **TextBox** components. Since we have processed the field values internally for the above mentioned components.

As we are using our Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> sub-components within our editor using template in the following example, the custom defined form elements needs to be configured as required Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> components such as **DropDownList** and **DateTimePicker** within the [`popupOpen`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#popupopen) event. This particular step can be skipped, if the user needs to simply use the usual form elements.

### How to customize header and footer using template

The editor window's header and footer can be enhanced with custom designs using the [`editorHeaderTemplate`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#editorheadertemplate) and [`editorFooterTemplate`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#editorfootertemplate) options. To achieve this, create a script template that includes the necessary fields. Ensure that the template type is set to **text/x-template**.

In this demo, we tailor the editor's header according to the appointment's subject field using the [`editorHeaderTemplate`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#editorheadertemplate). Furthermore, we make use of the [`editorFooterTemplate`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#editorfootertemplate) to handle the functionality of validating specific fields before proceeding with the save action or canceling it if validation requirements are not met.

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/editor-cs7" %}

### How to save the customized event editor using template

The **e-field** class is not added to each field defined within the template, so you should allow to set those field values externally by using the [`popupClose`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#popupclose) event.

Note: You can allow to retrieve the data only on the `save` and `delete` option. Data cannot be retrieved on the `close` and `cancel` options in the editor window.

The following code example shows how to save the customized event editor using a template by the [`popupClose`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#popupclose) event.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/editor-cs8/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/editor-cs8/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/editor-cs8/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/react/schedule/editor-cs8" %}

In case, if you need to prevent only specific popups on Scheduler, then you can check the condition based on the popup type. The types of the popup that can be checked within the [`popupClose`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#popupclose) event are as follows.

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Editor | For Detailed editor window.|
| QuickInfo | For Quick popup which opens on cell click.|
| EditEventInfo |For  Quick popup which opens on event click.|
| ViewEventInfo | For Quick popup which opens on responsive mode.|
| EventContainer | For more event indicator popup.|
| RecurrenceAlert | For edit recurrence event alert popup.|
| DeleteAlert | For delete confirmation popup.|
| ValidationAlert | For validation alert popup.|
| RecurrenceValidationAlert | For recurrence validation alert popup.|

## Quick popups

The quick info popups are the ones that gets opened, when a cell or appointment is single clicked on the desktop mode. On single clicking a cell, you can simply provide a subject and save it. Also, while single clicking on an event, a popup will be displayed where you can get the overview of the event information. You can also edit or delete those events through the options available in it.

To disable quick info popups, set [`showQuickInfo`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#showquickinfo) to `false`.

> Quick popups on cell single-click are not supported on mobile devices.

### How to open QuickInfo popup on multiple cell selection

By default the `QuickInfo` popup will open on single click of the cell. To open the quick info popup on multiple cell selection, you need to select the cells and press `enter` key. You can open this popup immediately after multiple cell selection by setting up `true` to `quickInfoOnSelectionEnd`[`quickInfoOnSelectionEnd`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#quickinfoonselectionend) property where as its default value is `false`.

### How to change the watermark text of quick popup subject

By default, `Add Title` text is displayed on the subject field of quick popup. To change the default watermark text, change the value of the appropriate localized word collection used in the Scheduler.

```ts
L10n.load({
    'en-US': {
        'schedule': {
          'addTitle' : 'New Title'
        }
    }
});
```

### Customizing quick popups

The look and feel of the built-in quick popup window, which opens when single clicked on the cells or appointments can be customized by making use of the [`quickInfoTemplates`](https://helpej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule/quickInfoTemplates) property of the Scheduler. There are 3 sub-options available to customize them easily,

* header - Accepts the template design that customizes the header part of the quick popup.
* content - Accepts the template design that customizes the content part of the quick popup.
* footer - Accepts the template design that customizes the footer part of the quick popup.

> The quick popup in adaptive mode can also be customized using [`quickInfoTemplates`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#quickinfotemplates)  using `e-device` class.

## More events indicator and popup

When the number of appointments count that lies on a particular time range * default appointment height exceeds the default height of a cell in month view and all other timeline views, a `+ more` text indicator will be displayed at the bottom of those cells. This indicator denotes that the cell contains few more appointments in it and clicking on that will display a popup displaying all the appointments present on that day.

> To disable this option of showing popup with all hidden appointments, while clicking on the text indicator, you can do code customization within the [`popupOpen`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#popupopen) event.

The same indicator is displayed on all-day row in calendar views such as day, week and work week views alone, when the number of appointment count present in a cell exceeds three. Clicking on the text indicator here will not open a popup, but will allow the expand/collapse option for viewing the remaining appointments present in the all-day row.

The following code example shows how to disable the display of such popups while clicking on the more text indicator.
