# How to perform CRUD actions in React Scheduler

CRUD actions can be manually performed on appointments using the [`addEvent`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#addevent), [`saveEvent`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#saveevent), and [`deleteEvent`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#deleteevent) methods in the [React Scheduler](https://www.syncfusion.com/react-components/react-scheduler), as shown below.

## Normal events

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/app-crud-cs6/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/app-crud-cs6/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/app-crud-cs6/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/schedule/app-crud-cs6" %}

## Recurring events

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/app-crud-cs7/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/app-crud-cs7/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/app-crud-cs7/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/schedule/app-crud-cs7" %}

> When a single occurrence of the recurrence appointment is edited, `recurrenceID` field will be added which holds the `id` value of its parent recurrence appointment. It is applicable only for the edited occurrence appointments. Therefore the collection passing to the `saveEvent` with action as **EditOccurrence** should have `RecurrenceID` field as shown above.
