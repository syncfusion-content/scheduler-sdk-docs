# How to show multiple colors in event in React Scheduler

In [React Scheduler](https://www.syncfusion.com/react-components/react-scheduler) we can display the multiple colors within a single event. This can be achieved by using the `template` option available within the [`eventSettings`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule/eventSettings) property. Here, we've used `SubCount` as an additional field. The SubCount field contains the background color and height values. Based on these values, events will be divided into different colors.
