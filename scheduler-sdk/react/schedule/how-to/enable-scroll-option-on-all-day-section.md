# How to enable scroll on the all-day section in React Scheduler

When you have a large number of appointments in the all-day row, it can be difficult to view them properly. In this case, you can enable an individual scroller for the all-day row by setting the [`enableAllDayScroll`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#enablealldayscroll) property to `true`, whereas its default value is `false`. When set to `true`, the all-day row displays a scroller when expanded beyond its maximum height.

> Note: This property is not applicable for Scheduler with height `auto`.
