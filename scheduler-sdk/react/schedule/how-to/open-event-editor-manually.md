# Open Editor Window Programmatically in React Scheduler

## Open Editor Window externally

The [React Scheduler](https://www.syncfusion.com/react-components/react-scheduler) allows users to manually open the event editor at a specific time or in response to certain events by using the [`openEditor`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#openeditor) method, as shown below.

## Open editor window on single click

By default, the Scheduler editor window opens when double-clicking cells or appointments. To open the editor window with a single click, use the [`openEditor`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#openeditor) method in [`eventClick`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#eventclick) and [`cellClick`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/schedule#cellclick) events handlers, and set the [`showQuickInfo`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#showquickinfo) property to `false`. The following example shows how to open editor window on single click of cells and appointments.
