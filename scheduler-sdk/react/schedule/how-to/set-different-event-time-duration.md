# Set different event time duration in React Schedule component

In event window, start/end time duration will be processed based on the [`interval`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule/timeScaleModel#interval) value within the [`timeScale`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule#timescale) property. By default, [`interval`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule/timeScaleModel#interval) value is 30, therefore in event window start/end time duration will be in 30 minutes duration. You can set custom interval range to the start/end time in event window using `popupOpen` event as shown below.
