# Accessibility in React Datepicker component

The DatePicker component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the DatePicker component is outlined below.

## WAI-ARIA attributes

Web accessibility standards define practices to make web content and applications accessible to users with disabilities. WAI-ARIA attributes are particularly valuable for dynamic content and advanced user interface controls built with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.

The DatePicker component provides built-in compliance with [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/examples/datepicker-dialog/) specifications through the following attributes applied to the input element: `aria-expanded`, `aria-disabled`, and `aria-activedescendant`. These attributes communicate the component's state and properties to assistive technologies, enabling disabled users to interact effectively with the DatePicker.

For related information, refer to the Calendar component's [Accessibility](../calendar/accessibility/) section.

* **aria-expanded**: Indicates the state of a collapsible element (expanded or collapsed).

* **aria-disabled**: Indicates the disabled state of the DatePicker component.

* **aria-activedescendant**: Helps manage the currently active descendant within the DatePicker component.

## Ensuring accessibility

The DatePicker component's accessibility levels are ensured through an [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the DatePicker component is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/accessibility/date-picker.html) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the DatePicker component with accessibility tools.
