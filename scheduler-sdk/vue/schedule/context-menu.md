# Context Menu in Vue Schedule Component

A context menu can be displayed on work cells and appointments in the Vue Schedule component by manually integrating the [`ContextMenu`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/context-menu/getting-started) ContextMenu control. In this approach, the ContextMenu component is added at the application level and its `target` property is set to the Schedule component’s DOM element.

On Scheduler cells, menu items such as `New Event`, `New Recurring Event` and `Today` can be displayed. For appointments, context menu options such as `Edit Event` and `Delete Event`. The default event editor can be opened for creating and editing appointments using the [`openEditor`](../api/schedule#openeditor) method of the Schedule component.

Appointment deletion can be performed using the [`deleteEvent`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/schedule#deleteevent) public method. Date navigation can be achieved using the [`selectedDate`](../api/schedule#selecteddate) property to programmatically move to the desired date.

> Custom menu items can also be displayed for both cells and appointments. In responsive mode, the context menu opens on tap‑hold interaction.
