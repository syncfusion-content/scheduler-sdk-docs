# Scheduler styling in Vue Schedule component

The appearance of the Vue Schedule component can be customized by overriding its default CSS classes or by creating and applying a custom theme. Syncfusion provides **Theme Studio** to help generate custom themes visually, which can then be applied to the Schedule component.

- Theme Studio: https://ej2.syncfusion.com/themestudio/?theme=tailwind3  

This section lists commonly used CSS class selectors that can be overridden to customize different areas of the Scheduler UI.
