# Calendar mode in Vue Schedule component

The Scheduler supports the following two types of calendar mode.

* Gregorian Calendar
* Islamic Calendar

## Gregorian Calendar

The Schedule component displays Gregorian calendar dates by default. The Gregorian calendar is a solar-based system with 12 months containing 28 to 31 days. Years divisible by four are considered leap years, containing 366 days, while standard years include 365 days.

## Islamic Calendar

The Islamic calendar, also known as the Hijri or Muslim calendar, is a lunar-based system consisting of 12 months with 354 or 355 days. Each month begins with the sighting of the new moon; therefore, months may contain either 29 or 30 days. Odd‑numbered months have 30 days, and even‑numbered months have 29 days.

> The current Islamic year is 1440 AH. Usually the Gregorian calendar runs from approximately 11 September 2018 to 30 August 2019 for this 1440 AH year.

The Schedule component includes a `calendarMode` property that switches between `Gregorian` and `Islamic` modes. The default value is `Gregorian`. To display Islamic calendar dates, set `calendarMode` to `Islamic`. The following example depicts, how to display the Islamic calendar dates on Scheduler.

To enable Islamic calendar functionality, import the `Calendar` and `Islamic` modules from the `ej2-calendars` package and inject them using the `Calendar.Inject` method. Additionally, the Islamic calendar requires the following CLDR data to be loaded using the `loadCldr` function:

* numberingSystems.json
* ca-gregorian.json
* numbers.json
* timeZoneNames.json
* ca-islamic.json

> For detailed guidance on installing CLDR data, refer to the  [`Internationalization`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/internationalization#installing-cldr-data) documentation.
