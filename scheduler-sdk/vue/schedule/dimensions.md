# Dimensions in Vue Schedule Component

The dimensions of the Schedule component refer to its overall height and width. These properties accept the following value types:

* auto
* pixel
* percentage

## Auto Height and Width

When height and width of the Scheduler are set to `auto`, it will try as hard as possible to keep an element the same width as its parent container. In other words, the parent container that holds Scheduler, it's width/height will be the sum of its children. By default, Scheduler is assigned with `auto` values for both height and width properties.

{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/dimension-cs1/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/dimension-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Height and Width in Pixel

The Schedule component renders its height and width based on exact pixel values when these values are specified. Both string and numeric formats are supported.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/dimension-cs2/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/dimension-cs2/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/dimension-cs2" %}

## Height and Width in Percentage

When height and width are defined as percentage values, the Schedule component adjusts proportionally to the size of its parent container.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/dimension-cs3/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/dimension-cs3/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/dimension-cs3" %}
