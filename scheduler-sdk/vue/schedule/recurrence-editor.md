# Recurrence editor in Vue Schedule component

The **Recurrence Editor** is a built-in component integrated into the Scheduler editor window. It enables the creation and management of recurring events by generating recurrence rule strings. The Recurrence Editor can also be used as a standalone component to handle recurrence-related operations independently.

> All the valid recurrence rule string mentioned in the [`iCalendar`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.10) specifications are applicable to use with the recurrence editor.

## Customizing the repeat type options in the editor

By default, the Recurrence Editor provides the following repeat options:

* Never
* Daily
* Weekly
* Monthly
* Yearly

It is possible to customize the recurrence editor to display only the specific repeat options such as `Daily` and `Weekly` options alone by setting the appropriate [`frequencies`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/recurrence-editor#frequencies) option.

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/recurrence-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

The other properties available in recurrence editor are tabulated below,

| Properties | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| firstDayOfWeek | number | Sets the first day of the week on recurrence editor.|
| startDate | Date | Sets the start date from which date the recurrence event starts. |
| dateFormat | string | Sets the specific date format on recurrence editor.|
| locale | string | Sets the locale to be applied on recurrence editor.|
| cssClass | string | Allows styling to be applied on recurrence editor with custom class names.|
| enableRtl | boolean | Allows recurrence editor to render in RTL mode.|
| minDate | Date | Sets the minimum date on recurrence editor.|
| maxDate | Date | Sets the maximum date on recurrence editor.|
| value | string | Sets the recurrence rule value on recurrence editor. |
| selectedType | number | Sets the specific repeat type on the recurrence editor.|

## Customizing the End Type Option in Editor

By default, the Recurrence Editor supports three end options:

* Never
* Until
* Count

It is possible to customize the recurrence editor to display only the specific end options, such as the `Until` and `Count` options alone, by setting the appropriate [`endTypes`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/recurrence-editor#endtypes) option.

{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Accessing the recurrence rule string

The recurrence rule is usually generated based on the options selected from the recurrence editor and also it follows the [`iCalendar`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.10) specifications. The generated recurrence rule string is a valid one to be used with the Scheduler event’s recurrence rule field.

There is a `change` event available in recurrence editor, that triggers on every time the fields of recurrence editor tends to change. Within this event argument, you can access the generated recurrence value through the `value` option as shown in the following code example.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/recur-editor-cs1/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/recur-editor-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/recur-editor-cs1" %}

## Set specific value on recurrence editor

The Recurrence Editor can be initialized with a predefined recurrence rule. When a rule string is passed using the `setRecurrenceRule` method, all related editor fields are updated automatically to reflect the corresponding configuration.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/recur-editor-cs2/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/recur-editor-cs2/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Recurrence date generation

You can parse the `recurrenceRule` of an event to generate the date instances on which that particular event is going to occur, using the `getRecurrenceDates` method. It generates the dates based on the `recurrenceRule` that we provide. The parameters to be provided for `getRecurrenceDates` method are as follows.

| Field name | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `startDate` | Date| Appointment start date. |
| `rule` | String| Recurrence rule present in an event object. |
| `excludeDate` | String | Date collection (in ISO format) to be excluded. It is **optional**. |
| `maximumCount` | Number | Number of date count to be generated. It is **optional**. |
| `viewDate` | Date | Current view range's first date. It is **optional**. |

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/recur-editor-cs3/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/recur-editor-cs3/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/recur-editor-cs3" %}

> The above example generates two dates—**January 7, 2018** and **January 9, 2018**—while excluding **January 8, 2018** and **January 10, 2018** using the exclusion list. Generated dates can then be utilized to create appointments.

## Recurrence date generation in server-side

It is also possible to generate recurrence date instances from server-side by manually referring the `RecurrenceHelper` class, which is specifically written and referred from application end to handle this date generation process.

> Refer [here](https://www.syncfusion.com/kb/10009/how-to-parse-the-recurrencerule-at-server-side) for the step by step procedure to achieve date generation in server-side.

## Restrict date generation with specific count

In case, if the rule is given in "NEVER ENDS" category, then you can mention the maximum count when you actually want to stop the date generation starting from the provided start date. To do so, provide the appropriate `maximumCount` value within the `getRecurrenceDates` method as shown in the following code example.
