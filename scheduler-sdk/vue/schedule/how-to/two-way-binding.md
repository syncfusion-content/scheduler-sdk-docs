# Two-Way Binding in Vue Scheduler

Two‑way binding in the Vue Schedule component can be configured by using the `v-model` directive. The Schedule properties that support two‑way binding are:

* selectedDate
* currentView

## Two-Way Binding With Vue Schedule Component's selectedDate Property

The following example demonstrates two‑way binding with the [`selectedDate`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/schedule#selecteddate) property. When the `selectedDate` value changes in the Schedule component, the value reflected in the associated DatePicker component is updated automatically, and changes in the DatePicker component propagate back to the Schedule.

## Two‑Way Binding With Vue Schedule Component's currentView Property

In the following example, when you change the `currentDate` value in the Vue Scheduler component, `v-model` will automatically update the value in the Dropdown component, and if you change the value in the Dropdown component, it will automatically update the value in the [Vue Scheduler](https://www.syncfusion.com/vue-components/vue-scheduler).

The following example demonstrates how to set the two-way-binding with the [`currentView`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/schedule#currentview) property in the Vue Scheduler.

{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/two-way-binding-cs2/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/two-way-binding-cs2/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
