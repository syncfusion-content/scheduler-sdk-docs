# Half Yearly View in Vue Schedule Component

The year view of our scheduler displays all the 365 days and their related appointments of a particular year. You can customize the year view by using the following properties.

* [`firstMonthOfYear`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/schedule#firstmonthofyear)
* [`monthsCount`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/schedule#monthscount)
* [`monthHeaderTemplate`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/schedule#monthheadertemplate)

The following example demonstrates how to render only the last six months of a year in the Schedule. To begin the view from June, the `firstMonthOfYear` property is set to `6`, and `monthsCount` is set to `6` to display six months in total.
