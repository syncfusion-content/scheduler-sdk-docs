# Scheduler interactions in Vue Schedule component

The Vue Schedule component supports rich **mouse**, **keyboard**, and **touch** interactions to create, view, and manage appointments efficiently across desktop and mobile environments. These interactions enable intuitive actions such as cell selection, event manipulation, navigation, and editing.

The following table outlines the supported interactions and how they differ between mouse and touch input modes.

|Actions        | Mouse interaction | Touch interaction |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Single click or tap on cells |  Single click on a cell to select a cell. | Single tapping on cells, will display a `+` icon on the cell. Tapping on it again will open the new event editor window. |
| Multiple cell selection | Single click on a cell and drag the selection to other cells to enable multiple cell selection. |  No multiple cell selection is allowed using touch gestures. |
| Event selection | Single click on an event to select it. | Tap holding on events, select an event and opens a small popup at the top holding the options to edit or delete. The popup also displays the selected event's subject. |
| Multiple event selection and deletion | Pressing `Ctrl` key and altogether single clicking on multiple events one after the other will enable multiple event selection. Pressing `Delete` key after event selection will delete all the selected events. |  Tap hold an event to select it, which opens a small popup at the top holding the options to edit or delete. As a continuation of this action, keep on single tapping on other events, to enable multiple event selection. Also, the popup displayed at the top remains in opened state, showing the count of the number of selected events. Pressing `Delete` option from the popup will delete all the selected events. |
| Date navigation | Clicking on the previous or next date navigation icons in the header bar allows you to navigate between dates. |  Swiping the scheduler view port to the left or right will allow you to navigate between the dates on touch devices. You can prevent the swiping action by disabling [`allowSwiping`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/schedule#allowswiping) property. NOTE: Swiping does not work when horizontal scroller present in the Scheduler. You can also make use of the previous and next navigation icons at the header bar to navigate. |
| View navigation | Click on an event and try moving it over the Scheduler to enable drag and drop action. |  The view options are available within the popup options at the top right extreme end of the header bar and you can choose the view from it. |

| Tooltip | Hover the mouse pointer over the events or resource header and the tooltip will be displayed. |  Tap holding the events will open the tooltip on events. |
| Open editor window  | Double click on cells or events to open the editor window. |  Double click on cells or events to open the editor window. Single tap on cells, which displays a `+` icon on the cell. Now, tap on it again to open the new event editor window.

## Disabling swipe navigation

Horizontal swipe navigation between dates can be disabled using the `allowSwiping` property. This is useful in scenarios where horizontal scrolling is enabled within the Scheduler layout.
