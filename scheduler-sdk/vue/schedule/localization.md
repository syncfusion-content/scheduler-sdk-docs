# Localization in Vue Schedule component

The Vue Schedule component supports globalization and localization features that allow it to adapt to different cultures, languages, date formats, and time formats. These capabilities enable applications to deliver a consistent and region‑specific scheduling experience for users across the globe.

You can adapt the Scheduler to various languages by parsing and formatting the date or number ([`Internationalization`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/internationalization)), adding culture specific customization and translation to the text ([`Localization`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/localization)).

## Globalization

The Internationalization library provides support for formatting and parsing the number, date, and time by using the official [`Unicode CLDR`](https://cldr.unicode.org) JSON data and also provides the `loadCldr` method to load the culture specific CLDR JSON data.

By default, Scheduler is set to follow the English culture ('en-US'). If you want to go with different culture other than English, follow the below steps.

* Install the `ej2-cldr-data` package using the Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> npm package by running the command below..

  ```
  npm install @syncfusion/ej2-cldr-data
  ```

Once the package is installed, you can find the culture specific JSON data under the location `\node_modules\@syncfusion\ej2-cldr-data`.

* Now import the required cultures from the installed location to `app.vue` file as given in the following code example.

    1. numberingSystems.json
    2. ca-gregorian.json
    3. numbers.json
    4. timeZoneNames.json

   ```ts
    //import the loadCldr from ej2-base
    import { loadCldr} from '@syncfusion/ej2-base';

    import { loadCldr} from '@syncfusion/ej2-base';
    import frNumberData from '@syncfusion/ej2-cldr-data/main/fr-CH/numbers.json';
    import frtimeZoneData from '@syncfusion/ej2-cldr-data/main/fr-CH/timeZoneNames.json';
    import frGregorian from '@syncfusion/ej2-cldr-data/main/fr-CH/ca-gregorian.json';
    import frNumberingSystem from '@syncfusion/ej2-cldr-data/supplemental/numberingSystems.json';

    loadCldr(frNumberData, frtimeZoneData, frGregorian, frNumberingSystem);
  ```

* Set the culture to Scheduler by using the `locale` property.

## Localizing the static Scheduler text

[`Localization`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/localization) library allows to display all the static text, date content, and time mode of the Scheduler following the localized language. To achieve this, set the `locale` property of Scheduler, as well as define the translation text of static words of Scheduler through the `load` method.

For example, the following code example lets you to define the French translation words for all the static words used in Scheduler. You can access the static text for all cultures from [`here`](https://github.com/syncfusion/ej2-locale).

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/localization-cs2/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/localization-cs2/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/localization-cs2" %}

The localized words for static text used in Scheduler and Recurrence Editor can be referred from the following code.

```ts

        }
    }
});
```

## Setting date format

Scheduler can be used with all valid date formats and by default it follows the universal date format "MM/dd/yyyy". If the [`dateFormat`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/schedule#dateformat) property is not specified particularly, then it will work based on the locale that is assigned to the Scheduler. As the default locale applied on Scheduler is "en-US", this makes it to follow the "MM/dd/yyyy" pattern.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/localization-cs3/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/localization-cs3/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/localization-cs3" %}

## Setting the time format

Time formats is a way of representing the time value in different string formats in the Scheduler. By default, the time mode of the Scheduler can be either 12 or 24 hours format which is completely based on the `locale` set to the Scheduler. Since the default `locale` value of the Scheduler is en-US, the time mode will be set to 12 hours format automatically. You can also customize the format by using the [`timeFormat`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/schedule#timeformat) property. To know more about the time format standards, refer to the [Date and Time Format](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/common/internationalization#custom-formats) section.

The following example demonstrates the Scheduler component in 24 hours format.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/localization-cs4/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/localization-cs4/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/localization-cs4" %}

>Note: [`timeFormat`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/schedule#timeformat) property only accepts the valid time format's.

## Displaying Scheduler in RTL mode

The Scheduler layout and its behavior can be changed as per the common RTL (Right to Left) conventions by setting [`enableRtl`](../api/schedule#enablertl) to `true`. By doing so, the Scheduler will display its usual layout from right to left. It's default value is `false`.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/localization-cs5/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/schedule/localization-cs5/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
