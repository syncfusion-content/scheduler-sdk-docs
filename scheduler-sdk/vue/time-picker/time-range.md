# Time range in Vue Timepicker component

TimePicker provides an option to select a time value within a specified range by using the [`min`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/timepicker#min) and [`max`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/timepicker#max) properties.  The min value should always be lesser than the max value.

When the min and max properties are configured and the selected time value is out-of-range or invalid, then the model value will be set to `out of range` time value or `null` respectively with highlighted `error` class to indicates the time is out of range or invalid.

The value property depends on the min/max with respect to [`strictMode`](./strict-mode/) property.

The following example allows you to select a time value within a range of `9:00 AM` to `11:30 AM`.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/time-picker/range-cs1/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/time-picker/range-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/time-picker/range-cs1" %}

> If the value of `min` or `max` property is changed through code behind you have to update the `value` property to set within the range.
