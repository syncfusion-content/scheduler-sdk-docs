# View in Vue Datepicker component

The [Vue DatePicker](https://www.syncfusion.com/vue-ui-components/vue-datepicker) has the following predefined views that provides a flexible way to navigate back and forth to select the date.

| **View** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| month (default) | Displays the days in a month |
| year | Displays the months in a year |
| decade | Displays the years in a decade |

## Start view

You can use the `start` property to define the initial rendering view.

The following example demonstrates how to create a DatePicker with `decade` as initial rendering view.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/date-picker/view-cs1/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/date-picker/view-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Depth view

Define the `depth` property to control the view navigation.

> Always the depth view has to be smaller than the start view, otherwise the view restriction will be not restricted.

The following example demonstrates how to create a DatePicker that allows users to select a month.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/date-picker/depth-cs1/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/scheduler-sdk/vue/date-picker/depth-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
